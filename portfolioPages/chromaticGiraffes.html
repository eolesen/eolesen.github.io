<h1> The ChromaticGiraffes Website</h1>
<p>I created a website as a school web design assignment in which my client was an artist friend. The website is her
    portfolio displaying her art, sketchbook, and info about her. Her artist screen name is ChromaticGiraffes, so that
    became the title for this project. The website was coded from scratch using html, and CSS, and Javascript.</p>

<h3>Dynamic Resizing</h3>
<video  controls src="../videos/ChromaticGiraffesResizeVideo.mp4" type="video/mp4" width="30%"></video>
<p> The website is also fairly dynamic, changing sizes of the text and other elements with the resizing of the window.</p>

<h3>Gallery Feature</h3>
<video controls src="../videos/ChromaticGiraffesGalleryVideo.mp4" width="30%"></video>
<p> It has a header with navigation bar, as well as an
    interactive gallery with multiple ways of navigating my client's sketchbook. There is also a cookie that saves your
    spot in the gallery.</p>


<p> I enjoyed coding this from the ground up, and I learned a lot about how to quickly adapt to meet the changing needs
    and requirements of the client while keeping the website usable to her stakeholders (people and customers interested in her art).
